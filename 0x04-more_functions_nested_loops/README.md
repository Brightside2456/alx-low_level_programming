**##More funtions and nested loops##**
- Task 0: Created a function to chaeck for upper case letters
- Task 1: Created function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- Task 2: Wrote a function that multiplies two integers.
- Task 3: Wrote a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- Task 4: Created a funtion that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4, followed by a new line.
- Task 5: Wrote a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line
- Task 6: Wrote a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
	- With this, the funtion prints only a new line when parameter is less than 1 or otherwise
- Task 7: Created a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
- Task 8: Wrote a funtion that prints a figure of equal length and width with # symbol
- Task 9: FizzBuzz
